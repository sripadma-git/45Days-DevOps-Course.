ðŸš€ Steps to Create a Virtual Machine (EC2 Instance) in AWS

1. Log in to AWS Console

Go to ðŸ‘‰ AWS Management Console.

Sign in with your account.

2. Navigate to EC2 Service

In the search bar, type EC2.

Click on EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud).

3. Launch Instance

Click Launch Instance (this means creating a new VM).

Enter:

Name â†’ e.g., MyFirstVM.

4. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

AMI = Operating System template for your VM.

Options:

Amazon Linux 2 (Free Tier Eligible) â€“ Lightweight Linux.

Ubuntu Server â€“ Popular Linux distro.

Windows Server â€“ If you want Windows.

5. Choose Instance Type

Instance type = CPU + Memory combination.

For beginners:

t2.micro or t3.micro (Free Tier eligible, 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM).

6. Key Pair (Login Credentials)

Select Create new key pair (if first time).

Type: RSA, .pem file.

Download the key pair â†’ Keep it safe (you need it to SSH into the VM).

Example: my-key.pem.

7. Network Settings

Select default VPC.

Security group:

Allow SSH (port 22) for Linux.

Allow RDP (port 3389) for Windows.

8. Configure Storage

By default: 8 GB EBS volume (you can increase).

Leave default for Free Tier.

9. Review and Launch

Click Launch Instance.

Wait â†’ Instance will start running.

10. Connect to Your VM

Select your instance â†’ Click Connect.

For Linux:

chmod 400 my-key.pem
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>


For Ubuntu:

ssh -i my-key.pem ubuntu@<Public-IP>


For Windows:

Download RDP file.

Use username & password (decrypt with key pair).

âœ… Now you have your own Virtual Machine running in AWS.
