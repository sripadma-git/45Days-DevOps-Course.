🌐 Virtual Machines (VMs)
🔹 What is a Virtual Machine?

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer.
It runs an operating system (OS) and applications just like a real computer, but it’s isolated from the host system.

👉 Example: Running Linux Ubuntu VM inside a Windows PC using VMware or VirtualBox.

🔹 How VMs Work

A Hypervisor (software or firmware) sits between the hardware and the VMs.

The hypervisor allocates CPU, RAM, storage, and networking to each VM.

Each VM runs independently, even if they share the same physical machine.

🔹 Types of Hypervisors

Type 1 (Bare Metal)

Runs directly on physical hardware.

Examples: VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen, KVM.
✅ High performance, used in data centers & cloud.

Type 2 (Hosted)

Runs on top of a host OS.

Examples: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation.
✅ Easier to use on personal systems.

🔹 Features of VMs

Isolation: Each VM has its own OS & resources.

Encapsulation: VM is stored as files (can be moved/copied).

Portability: Can migrate VMs between servers.

Snapshot & Cloning: Save VM state or duplicate it.

🔹 Advantages

Run multiple OS on a single machine.

Cost savings (one server runs many VMs).

Strong isolation → security.

Easy backup & recovery with snapshots.

Scalability → can add/remove VMs quickly.

🔹 Disadvantages

Performance overhead (VMs are slower than containers).

Requires powerful hardware.

More resource usage (CPU, RAM).

Management can be complex at scale.
