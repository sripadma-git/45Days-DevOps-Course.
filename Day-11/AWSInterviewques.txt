What is AWS?
AWS is a cloud provider offering IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service).
AWS simplifies complex infrastructure tasks by providing them as managed services (e.g., Kubernetes as a service).
Users can scale services without worrying about underlying infrastructure management.

Core AWS Services for DevOps Engineers

1.EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):

Virtual servers in the cloud to deploy applications.
Previously demonstrated deploying web apps on EC2.
Essential for understanding cloud compute resources.

2.VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):

Enables secure networking for EC2 instances.
Includes components like security groups, subnets, CIDR blocks, inbound/outbound traffic rules.
Critical for securing cloud resources.
To be covered in intermediate AWS sessions with live projects.

3.EBS (Elastic Block Store):

Persistent storage volumes attached to EC2 instances.
Used for databases or applications generating files.
Supports snapshots, backups, detach/reattach workflows.
Fundamental for managing application storage on AWS.

4.S3 (Simple Storage Service):

Object storage for files, backups, logs, etc.
Cost-effective and highly scalable.
Supports encryption by default now, versioning, and access control.
Widely used for storing application-related data like config files, logs, and large datasets.

5.IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Manages user permissions and security policies.
Controls who can access AWS resources and what actions they can perform.
Vital for enforcing least privilege and organizational compliance.
Integrates with tools like Jenkins and GitHub to control access rights.

6.CloudWatch:

Monitoring and observability service.
Tracks logs, metrics, and events for AWS resources.
Enables alerting based on thresholds (e.g., CPU usage).
Supports automation via triggers for operational actions.

7.Lambda

Serverless compute service for running short-lived functions.
Automatically manages computing resources without provisioning servers.
Ideal for automating tasks triggered by CloudWatch events.
Example: Automatically encrypting unencrypted EBS volumes upon creation.

Additional Important AWS Services for DevOps

8.Cloud Build Services (CI/CD)

AWS CodePipeline: Manages the workflow similar to Jenkins pipelines.
AWS CodeBuild: Fully managed build service for compiling code, running tests, producing artifacts.
AWS CodeDeploy: Automates deployment of applications to EC2 or on-premises servers.
Useful for integrating CI/CD pipelines within AWS.
Consider migration from Jenkins if fully on AWS, but beware vendor lock-in for multi-cloud strategies.


9.AWS Config

Tracks and audits resource configurations.
Helps maintain compliance (e.g., ensuring all EBS volumes are encrypted).
Supports automated remediation actions.

10.Billing and Cost Management

Monitors cloud spending by service and time period.
Essential for cost optimization and budget control.


11.KMS (Key Management Service)

Manages encryption keys and secrets.
Used to secure sensitive data like certificates and encrypted buckets or volumes.
Supports key rotation and integrates with other AWS services.

12.CloudTrail

Records API calls and user actions for auditing and compliance.
Provides historical logs for troubleshooting and security analysis.
Essential for operational risk management.

13.Container Services

EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Managed Kubernetes service.
If familiar with Kubernetes, learning EKS is straightforward.
ECS (Elastic Container Service): AWS proprietary container orchestration (non-Kubernetes).
Fargate: Serverless container runtime allowing containers without managing servers.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Popular logging and analytics stack.
Useful for aggregating and analyzing logs from microservices.
Helps identify common errors and performance issues across distributed systems.
